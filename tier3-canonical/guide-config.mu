>Configuration Options

To change the configuration of Nomad Network, you must edit the configuration file. If you did not manually specify a config path when you started the program, Nomad Net will look for a configuration in the folllowing directories:

  `!/etc/nomadnetwork`!
  `!~/.config/nomadnetwork`!
  `!~/.nomadnetwork`!

If no existing configuration file is found, one will be created at `!~/.nomadnetwork/config`! by default. The default configuration file contains comments on all the different configuration options present, and explains their possible settings.

You can open the configuration file in any text-editor, and change the options. You can also use the editor built in to this program, under the `![ Config ]`! menu item. If the built-in editor does not gain focus, and your navigation keys are not working, try hitting enter or space, which should focus the editor and let you navigate the text.

For reference, all the configuration options are listed and explained here as well. The configuration is divided into different sections, each with their own options.

>> Logging Section

This section hold configuration directives related to logging output, and is delimited by the `![logging]`! header in the configuration file. Available directives, along with their default values, are as follows:

>>>
`!loglevel = 4`!
>>>>
Sets the verbosity of the log output. Must be an integer from 0 through 7.
>>>>>
0: Log only critical information
1: Log errors and lower log levels
2: Log warnings and lower log levels

5: Verbose logging
6: Debug logging
7: Extreme logging
<

>>>
`!destination = file`!
>>>>
Determines the output destination of logged information. Must be `!file`! or `!console`!.
<

>>>
`!logfile = ~/.nomadnetwork/logfile`!
>>>>
Path to the log file. Must be a writable filesystem path.

<

>>>
`!required_stamp_cost = None`!
>>>>
You can specify a required stamp cost for inbound messages to be accepted. Specifying a stamp cost will require untrusted senders that message you to include a cryptographic stamp in their messages. Performing this operation takes the sender an amount of time proportional to the stamp cost. As a rough estimate, a stamp cost of 8 will take less than a second to compute, and a stamp cost of 20 could take several minutes, even on a fast computer.
<

>>>
`!accept_invalid_stamps = False`!
>>>>
You can signal stamp requirements to senders, but still accept messages with invalid stamps by setting this option to True.
<

>>>
`!max_accepted_size = 500`!

>>>
`!intro_text = Nomad Network`!
>>>>
The text to display on the intro screen.
<

>>>
`!editor = editor`!
>>>>
What editor program to use when launching a text editor from within the program. Defaults to the `!editor`! alias, which in turn will use the default editor of the operating system.
<

>>>
`!glyphs = unicode`!
>>>>
Determines what set of glyphs the program uses for rendering the user interface.
>>>>>
The `!plain`! set only uses ASCII characters, and should work on all terminals, but is rather boring.
The `!unicode`! set uses more interesting glyphs and icons, and should work on most terminals. This is the default.

`!files_path = ~/.nomadnetwork/storage/files`!
>>>>
Determines where the node server will look for downloadable files. Must be a readable filesystem path.
<

>>>
`!file_refresh_interval = 0`!
>>>>
Determines the interval in minutes for rescanning the hosted files path. By default, this option is disabled, and the files path will only be scanned on startup.
<

>>>
`!disable_propagation = yes`!
>>>>
When Nomad Network is hosting a node, it can also run an LXMF propagation node. If there is already a large amount of propagation nodes on the network, or you simply want to run a pageserving-only node, you can disable running a propagation node.
<

>>>

>>>>
Configures the maximum amount of storage, in megabytes, that the LXMF Propagation Node will use to store messages.
<

>>>
`!max_transfer_size = 256`!
>>>>
The maximum accepted transfer size per incoming propagation transfer, in kilobytes. This also sets the upper limit for the size of single messages accepted onto this propagation node. If a node wants to propagate a larger number of messages to this node, than what can fit within this limit, it will prioritise sending the smallest, newest messages first, and try with any remaining messages at a later point.
<

>>>
`!prioritise_destinations = 41d20c727598a3fbbdf9106133a3a0ed, d924b81822ca24e68e2effea99bcb8cf`!

<

>>>
`!print_command = lp -d PRINTER_NAME -o cpi=16 -o lpi=8`!
>>>>
Specifies the command that Nomad Network uses to print the message. Defaults to "lp". The above example works well for small thermal-roll printers.
<

>Ignoring Destinations

If you encounter peers or nodes on the network, that you would rather not see in your client, you can add them to the `!~/.nomadnetwork/ignored`! file. To ignore nodes or peers, add one 32-character hexadecimal destination hash per line to the file. To unignore one again, simply remove the corresponding entry from the file and restart Nomad Network.
