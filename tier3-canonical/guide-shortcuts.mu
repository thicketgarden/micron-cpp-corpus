>>`!Input Field Editing`!
All text input fields support readline-style editing shortcuts. When an input
field is focused, these take precedence over any window shortcut mapped to the
same key (so, for example, Ctrl-U edits the line rather than toggling a pane):
 - Ctrl-A      Move to beginning of line
 - Ctrl-E      Move to end of line
 - Ctrl-U      Delete from cursor to beginning of line
 - Ctrl-K      Delete from cursor to end of line
 - Ctrl-W      Delete previous word (whitespace-delimited)
 - Ctrl-L      Delete the entire buffer
 - Ctrl-Y      Paste (yank) most recently deleted text
 - Ctrl-Left   Move backward one word
 - Ctrl-Right  Move forward one word

Text deleted with Ctrl-U, Ctrl-K, Ctrl-W or Ctrl-L is placed in a shared yank
buffer that Ctrl-Y pastes back, so text can be moved between input fields.
